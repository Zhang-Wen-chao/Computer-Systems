/*
There are two classes named Car and Driver, suppose the car can drive automatically, and driver also can drive the car. The declarations of car and driver are as follows:

Implement all the member functions of the two classes and make Driver as Carâ€™s friend class so that it can access the members of Car. Write a program to test the two classes.


class Car
{
private:
  enum {Off, On}; //Off- non automatically drive, On-automatically drive
  enum {Minvel, Maxvel = 200}; //range of velocity from 0 to 200
  int mode;   //mode of car, Off or On
  int velocity;

public:
  friend class Driver;
  Car(int m = On, int v = 50):mode(m),velocity(v){ }
  bool velup(int v);   //increase velocity by v
  bool veldown(int v);  //decrease velocity by v
  bool ison() const;  //Check whether the mode is on 
  int getvel() const;  //get the velocity
  void showinfo() const; // show the mode and velocity of car
};

class Driver
{
public:
  
  bool velup(Car& car,int v);   //increase velocity by v
  bool veldown(Car& car, int v);  //decrease velocity by v
  void setmode(Car& car);   //If the mode is On, set it to Off,otherwise set it to Off
  bool ison(Car& car) const; //Check whether the mode is on 
};


output sample:
The information of car:mode is On,velocity is 50
Increase velocity by car,its mode is On,velocity is 170
Set the mode of car by driver:
The mode of car is:On.
The information of car:mode is Off,velocity is 170
Decrease velocity by driver:mode is Off,velocity is 70
Increase velocity by driver: The velocity is 220. It is Out of Maxvel.
